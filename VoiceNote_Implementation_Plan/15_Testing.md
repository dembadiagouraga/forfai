# Step 15: Testing the Voice Note Feature

## Overview
Now that we've implemented the voice note feature, we need to test it thoroughly to ensure it works correctly and doesn't affect existing functionality.

## Test Cases

### 1. Recording Voice Notes
- Open the product creation form
- Click the "Record voice message" button
- Record a voice note (test both short and long recordings)
- Verify that recordings under 3 seconds show an error
- Verify that recordings over 2 minutes are automatically stopped
- Verify that the recording preview shows correctly with the correct duration

### 2. Playing Voice Notes in Create/Edit Form
- Record a voice note in the product creation form
- Click the play button to play the recording
- Verify that the play button changes to a pause button
- Click the pause button to pause playback
- Verify that the pause button changes back to a play button
- Click the delete button to remove the recording
- Verify that the recording is removed and the record button is shown again

### 3. Creating Products with Voice Notes
- Create a product with a voice note
- Submit the form
- Verify that the product is created successfully
- Open the product detail page
- Verify that the voice note player is shown
- Play the voice note and verify it plays correctly

### 4. Editing Products with Voice Notes
- Open the edit form for a product with a voice note
- Verify that the existing voice note is shown
- Play the voice note and verify it plays correctly
- Delete the voice note and save the product
- Verify that the voice note is removed from the product
- Edit the product again and add a new voice note
- Verify that the new voice note is saved correctly

### 5. Admin Side Testing
- Open the admin product detail page for a product with a voice note
- Verify that the voice note player is shown
- Play the voice note and verify it plays correctly

### 6. Edge Cases
- Test with very short recordings (should show error)
- Test with recordings close to the 2-minute limit
- Test with poor network conditions
- Test with different audio formats (if applicable)
- Test on different devices and screen sizes

### 7. Regression Testing
- Verify that existing product creation/editing functionality works correctly
- Verify that products without voice notes display correctly
- Verify that other features (chat, etc.) are not affected
- Verify that the app performance is not significantly impacted

## Expected Results
- Voice notes can be recorded, played, and deleted in the product forms
- Voice notes are correctly saved and displayed in product details
- Voice notes are correctly displayed in the admin interface
- Existing functionality continues to work correctly
- The app remains stable and performant

## Notes
- Test on multiple devices if possible
- Test with different network conditions
- Report and fix any issues before deploying to production
